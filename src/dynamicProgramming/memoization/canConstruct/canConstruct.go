/*
Write a function `canConstruct(target, wordBank)` that accepts a target string and an array of strings.
The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the `target` can be constructed by concatenating elements of the `wordBank` array.
You may reuse elements of `wordBank` as many times as needed.

example:
canConstruct("abcdef", ["ab", "abc", "cd", "def", "abcd"]) -> true

canConstruct("skateboard", ["bo", "rd", "ate", "t", "ska", "sk", "boar"]) -> false
ska + t + ?
sk + ate + boar + ?
sk + ate _ bo + ?


canConstruct("", ["cat", "dog", "mouse"]) -> true
empty string generation takes 0 elements from the array
